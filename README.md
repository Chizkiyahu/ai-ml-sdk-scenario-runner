# ML SDK Scenario Runner

The Scenario Runner is an application that executes shader and neural network
graph workloads through the Vulkan® or Arm® Vulkan® ML extensions. The
Scenario Runner acts as a validation and performance exploration vehicle. The
Scenario Runner also acts as a mechanism to define test-cases called scenarios
in a declarative way via a JSON description. The Scenario Runner can parse the
JSON, load the input stimulus that is described in the JSON, execute the
scenario and produce output artefacts.
